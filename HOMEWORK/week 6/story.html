				From <a href="http://happyplanetindex.org">HappyPlanetIndex.org</a> I could see a list of
				countries, sorted by ranking of Happiness. There were several factors that contributed to 
				the happiness index, but I thought it would be interesting to see how much of an impact 
				a country's quality of life had on it. Therefore I compared the data from HappyPlanetIndex.org
				to data I found on <a href="https://www.numbeo.com/quality-of-life/rankings_by_country.jsps">Numbeo</a>.
				<br/>
				<br/>
				The world map shows a visualisation of the countries of which a happiness index score is
				known. They are color sorted, darker orange meaning the country has a high happiness index,
				while light orange shows that a country has a low happiness index. When hovering over a 
				country, the precise index score is shown, while also its world ranking is shown. 
				<br/>
				The scatterplot shows how the happiness index is compared to the QoL score. When clicking
				on a country on the world map, only the dot of that country is shown on the scatterplot, 
				so its respective values can easily be seen. 
				<br/>
				<br/>
				When looking at the comparison between the happiness index and the QoL score,
				you can see that countries with a high happiness index are leaning more torward the right
				side of the plot, meaning they have a high quality of life score. The are definitely outliers,
				such as Venezuela, which has a fairly high happiness index (ranked 29 in the world!), but
				a quality life score of 0. The political and economical crisis in Venezuela may be an 
				explanation for this irregularity.
